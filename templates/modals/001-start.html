        <p>While going through this process, Kometa is going to load the items in your library, create some collections,
          and apply some overlays. If you have a large library, this will be very time-consuming.</p>
        <p>For learning and testing, it is advisable to create a small test library of a reasonable sizeâ€”preferably
          below a thousand items.</p>

        <p>You may choose to take advantage of the <a href="https://github.com/chazlarson/plex-test-libraries"
            target="_blank">plex-test-libraries repository</a>, which contains pre-made videos to use when following
          this guide.</p>

        <p>Using the plex-test-libraries repository will ensure enough variety in media to populate the example
          collections. Running some of these default collections against a library of a few thousand movies can take
          hours, and for iterative testing, it's useful to have something that will run in a few minutes or seconds.</p>

        <p>To clone the repository, navigate to your desired storage location and run:</p>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chazlarson/plex-test-libraries</code>
<code>cd plex-test-libraries</code></pre>

        <p>You should now have two folders, <code>test_tv_lib</code> and <code>test_movie_lib</code>. Mount each of
          these as a library within Plex and use them in Quickstart.</p>
